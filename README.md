🔍 Project Highlight: Customer Churn Prediction 🔍

Thrilled to share the details of my work on the Customer Churn Prediction project during my internship at CodSoft! 📊

In this project, I developed a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service using historical customer data, including usage behavior and demographics. I experimented with various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting, and achieved promising results with the Random Forest model.

This project was a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into predictive analytics and enhance my understanding of customer behavior.

A huge thanks to CodSoft for this enriching experience! 🌟
